Project to update in Bulk the Microsoft Customer Agreement in Microsoft Partner Portal through Powershell

This Powershell Script is created as a Raw method of updating the Microsoft Customer Agreement in the Microsoft Partner Network Portal. Now and then Microsoft Updates its Customer Agreement en resets all agreements in the Partner Portal. As this agreement is a requirement for customers to do business with Microsoft through their partners, the partners need to inform the customers about the new agreement, and after confirmation, update the fields of the agreement in the Partner Portal. 

When having a lot of customers, and a signed Cloud Agreement, this would be a time consuming task to do this through a web browser and the Portal. This script assumes you have an export of the customers from the Partner Portal in Excel XLSX format. It uses the found clients details and with a status Reseller, and creates a new customer agreement with the found details if this fits your business requirements.

This script is free to use and Modify for your specific needs. It is intentionally not made complex.
